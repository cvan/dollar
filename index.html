                        Kestrel&rsquo;s eyes gazed up in awe as his lips curled at the ends. With an extented arm he pointed at the exotic giant before us. His small fingertips gently brushed the bumpy skin of the tall creature. From its roots to its leaves it exuded great strength. Bright shades of green protected us from the sun&rsquo;s rays like an umbrella shields rain on a gray day in London. The tree was gorgeous. Its beauty was apparent to most, for it was visually pleasing. But the beauty Kestrel saw in the tree was not noticed by the passerbys. He adorned that tree for its structure and its complexities. His brown eyes gazed lustfully at the tree&rsquo;s branches acknowledging the possibilities each limb could grant him. For him this tree was perfect &mdash; for it was a tree to be climbed. Kestrel wrapped his arm&rsquo;s around the giants trunk as laced his fingers at its back. He quickly shimmied his arms up until he got his footing in a nook between the trunk and a lower branch. His hands moved from branch to branch as his feet followed quickly in the same path. Higher and Higher he would climb until he could climb no more. And there in the canopy he would sit.

                        I guess his name was Booby. That&rsquo;s what we called him anyway. He landed on that yellow runway with such a presence. As he swooped down from the sky, the sun descended from high above. His leathery feet were as blue as a robin&rsquo;s egg, and his open wings were as regal as a prince gesturing for a dance with his princess. When he stepped upon the surfboard he gingerly tacked his shoulders back and tucked his wings behind him, his chest high in the air. Loraine looked up from her book, and Booby stared in her direction. Excusing herself from her focus she walked towards the back of the boat. Booby inched forwards. Lorine&rsquo;s hazel eyes danced their way across Booby&rsquo;s feathers. Booby&rsquo;s beak twitched with curiosity. There they stood, nose to beak in the middle of the ocean pondering each others existence in paradise. The moment had passed as Booby looked to the air, Loraine returned to her book and on we sailed deep into the Caribbean.
